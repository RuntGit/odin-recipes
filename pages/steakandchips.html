    <h2>Steak and Chips</h2>
    <p>This is a really simple guide to making the best steak and chips.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Large Maris Piper potatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 x 220g/8oz sirloin steak</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Dijon mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the chips, peel the potatoes and cut into whatever size you prefer. Wash well in cold water until the water runs clear, drain and pat dry with a clean teatowel.</li>
        <li>Fill a deep-fat fryer or a large, deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan two-thirds full with vegetable oil. Heat the oil to 140C–160C, using a thermometer to check the temperature if you're not using a deep-fat fryer. (CAUTION: Hot oil can be dangerous. Don't leave unattended.)</li>
        <li>Carefully place the chips in the hot oil and cook for 7–8 minutes or until just cooked through (without colouring). Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon, drain on kitchen paper and set aside to cool. You may do this a few hours in advance, keeping the chips covered, in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, to finish the chips, deep fry the chips in batches again in the oil at 180C for 2 minutes, or until crisp and golden brown. Drain on kitchen paper and season lightly with salt.</li>
        <li>For the steak, cut small slits across the line of fat on the steak and drizzle a little oil over the fat. Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. Salt the edge of the fat on the steak and place it onto the pan, standing it up on the fatty edge. Hold it there for a few seconds until the fat begins to run down the grooves of the grill; this is all the lubrication you will need to cook the steak. </li>
        <li>Allow the steak to fall over, season it very lightly with salt and plenty of pepper, then grill for 2 minutes on each side for a rare steak; 3 minutes for medium; and 4 minutes for well done. However, remember the thinner the steak, the less the cooking time.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, leave the steak to rest on a warm plate in a warm place (such as a very low oven) for a few minutes, so that the juices will settle evenly within the meat, while also allowing the meat to relax and become even more tender.</li>
        <li>Serve the steak and chips with Dijon mustard.</li>
    </ol>
